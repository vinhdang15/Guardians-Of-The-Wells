# About the Game
Guardians Of The Wells is a 2D tower defense game inspired by Kingdom Rush. However, instead of a traditional endpoint, the core objective revolves around defending a sacred well. Enemies spawn from a designated point on the map and attempt to reach the well. If they succeed, they pollute the water, causing the environment to decay dynamically.
The game features various tower types, soldier deployment, enemy AI, and skill effects, all designed for an engaging tower defense experience.
