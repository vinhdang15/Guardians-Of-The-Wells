# About the Game
Guardians Of The Wells is a 2D tower defense game inspired by Kingdom Rush. At its current stage, the core mechanics closely resemble Kingdom Rush, featuring various tower types, soldier deployment, enemy AI, and skill effects to create a classic tower defense experience.
In future development phases, the game will introduce a unique twist: instead of a traditional endpoint, players will defend a sacred well. Enemies will attempt to reach the well, and if they succeed, they will pollute the water, dynamically affecting the environment. This mechanic will set the game apart by adding an evolving battlefield element.
